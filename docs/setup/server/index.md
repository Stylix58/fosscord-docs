# Server Setup

{{ project.name }}-server setup ranges in difficulty depending on how you want to configure your system.
This page provides a minimal setup guide to get you up and running,
you should check out the other pages on this site to take your instance to the next level.

For this guide, we assume you're familar with the terminal.

We do **not** recommend or support running {{ project.name }} using services such as Ngrok or Heroku.  
You **must** have access to a terminal for this guide.

We do not recommend using Windows to run {{ project.name }}.

## Docker

To use docker please read the following page:

-   [Docker](docker.md)

## Dependencies

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). Version 16+
- [Python](https://www.python.org/). Version 3+. Make sure this is executable via `python` in your terminal.  
    (See: `python-is-python3` package)
- On Linux: `gcc`/`g++`. Packaged with `build-essential` on Debian/Ubuntu and `base-devel` on Arch.
- On Windows: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (**NOT** VSCode) with the `Desktop development with C++` package.
    You do not need the full Visual Studio install, the build tools are fine.

## Setup

In your terminal:

```bash
# Download {{ project.name }}
git clone {{ repositories.base_url }}/{{ repositories.server }}.git

# Navigate to project root
cd {{ project.name.lower() }}-server

# Install javascript packages
npm i

# Build and generate schema. Separately, they are `build` and `generate:schema`.
npm run setup

# Start the bundle server ( API, CDN, Gateway in one )
npm run start
```

If all went according to plan, you can now access your new {{ project.name }} instance at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)! Congrats!

If you set up your server remotely, you can use `curl http://localhost:3001/api/ping` to verify the server is up and running,
(you should set up a reverse proxy, next!).

## Now what?

Well, now you can configure {{ project.name }} to your liking!

- [Skip to reverse proxy / SSL](reverseProxy.md)
