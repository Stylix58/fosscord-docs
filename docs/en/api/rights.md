# User rights

## Introduction

User rights are instance-wide per-user permission toggle that affects instance-wide permissions of users,
such as the ability to edit one's own messages.

You may modify a users rights by editing the `rights` column in the `users` table.  
See [Database](/server/database) and [Configuration](/server/configuration) for more information.

The rights value is a bitfield string, and to grant multiple rights you must add their values together.
For example, to grant `CREATE_GUILDS` and `SEND_MESSAGES`, grant the user(s)   
`(1 << 15) = 32768` +  
`(1 << 25) = 33554432` =  
`33587200`

!!! warning "The default rights are current `0`. ***NEVER*** set default rights to `1` ( `OPERATOR` ), as this allows ANY USER to perform ANY ACTION including shutting down the server. ONLY EVER GIVE YOURSELF `OPERATOR` RIGHTS."

The rights value `648540060672` emulates the rights of users on Discord.com, granting:
